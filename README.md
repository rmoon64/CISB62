# Project Name: Iris classification

## The Iris classification dataset is a classic dataset that will help us predict the species of iris flowers based on their various measurements. It utilizes the load_iris function from sklearn.
## The Iris dataset consists of 150 entries of iris flowers, with each sample having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
## The flowers in the dataset belong to three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
## The goal of the project is to train a ANN model to accurately classify iris flowers into one of these three species based on their measurements.
